# Noodl docs

Welcome to the Noodl docs project! This is a open-source project aimed at providing detailed and up-to-date documentation for users of Noodl. Whether you're a beginner, intermediate, or advanced Noodl user, you will find this documentation invaluable.

## About Noodl

Noodl is the low-code platform where designers and developers build custom applications and experiences. Designed as a visual programming environment, it aims to expedite your development process. It promotes swift and efficient creation of applications, requiring minimal coding knowledge.

## Getting Started

This project is using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to help us ship a beautiful documentation site.

In order to run this project locally, you need to follow the steps below:

```bash
# Clone the repository to your local machine using the command below in your terminal or an external git client.
git clone https://github.com/noodlapp/noodl-docs.git

# Navigate into the project's directory.
cd repository

# Install the project dependencies.
npm install

# Start the development server.
npm run start
```

Now, you should be able to view the project in your preferred browser through `localhost:3000`.

## FAQ

##### Can I preview my changes in the Noodl editor?

Yes, when the Noodl editor starts up it will check anything running on `localhost:3000` and if it recognize that it is the Noodl docs it will use the local endpoint instead of the live docs.

##### How do we deploy the changes?

Currently people at Noodl will deploy the changes manually, until we have an automatic system in place.
