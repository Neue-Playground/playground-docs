# Node Reference

The main building blocks of Noodl are nodes. Every node has its own specific purpose and is very simple in itself, but together they become really powerful. Here you will find an overview of all Core Nodes, their type and category.

Noodl can also be extended with Modules that give you more nodes to build with. Check out the [Module library](/library/modules/overview) for the ones that already exist, or the [Extending Noodl section](/javascript/extending/overview) to learn how to develop your own.
