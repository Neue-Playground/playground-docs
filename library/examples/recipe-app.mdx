# Recipe App

This is a simple app for managing recipes built to demonstrate how to work with [Arrays](/nodes/data/array/array-node). It's not connected to a backend but is using the [Static Array](/nodes/data/array/static-array) node. It shows how to add and remove items from an **Array** as well as some simple filtering. It also includes a little bit of **Navigation** logic.

To learn more about how it's built you can follow the [Array Guide](/docs/guides/data/arrays).
