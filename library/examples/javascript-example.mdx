# Javascript Example

This example shows how you can mix and match nodes with Javascript in Noodl. It implements a multi select list with a couple of operations on the list, such as batch delete and copy.
The example is walked through in detail in the [Business logic with Javascript guide](/docs/guides/business-logic/client-side-biz-logic-js).

<div className="ndl-image-with-background m">

<ImportButton zip="/library/examples/javascript-example/biz-logic-js.zip" name="Mapbox Example" thumb="/library/examples/javascript-example/final-1.png" />

</div>
