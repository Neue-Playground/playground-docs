# Task List App
This is a simple example of a Task List App. It's a great starting point if you want to learn about the basics in Noodl. It shows how to do simple **Layouts** with **UI Controls**. It also uses a simple **Backend** with a **Database** to store the tasks created by the users. There is also a [Build Along](/docs/build-alongs/task-list-app) series that walks through the complete app.
