# Modules

Modules allow you to extend Noodl by installing new **core nodes** to use in your app. They are often used for third party integrations or complex UI.

Learn how to add a module to your project [here](/docs/guides/user-interfaces/modules), or how you can extend Noodl yourself by building your own module with JavaScript or TypeScript [here](/javascript/extending/overview).
