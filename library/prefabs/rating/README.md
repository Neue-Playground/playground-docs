# Rating

A UI component for selecting a rating from 1 to 5 with stars. Adding more starts or a different scale can easily be modified in the component. This UI component uses the **Icon node** to show the stars, and can be changed to other icons as well like hearts, smileys, etc. if preferred.

After cloning the prefab you will see a logic component called **Rating** in your project. Place it into the dom-tree to render it. 

You can both set a rating to be displayed via the **Rating Input**, and get the selected rating from the **Rating Output** as shown on the image below.

The **Rating** output is a number between 1-5 by default.
