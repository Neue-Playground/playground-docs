# Filters

This prefab can be used to dynamically create filter controls that connect to a [Query Records](/nodes/data/cloud-data/query-records) node.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/library/prefabs/filters/filters-1.png)

</div>

This guide will show you how to use the filters prefab and the different controls plus how to connect it to [Query Records](/nodes/data/cloud-data/query-records). To use it, clone the prefab into your project this will create a `Filters` component in your default sheet.

## Basic usage

Below you can see a typical setup with the `Filters` component and a [Query Records](/nodes/data/cloud-data/query-records) together with a [Table](/library/prefabs/table/). 

<div className="ndl-image-with-background xl">

![](/library/prefabs/filters/filters-nodes-1.png)

</div>

The `Filters` component have an output aptly named <span class="ndl-data">Filters</span> that has the same format as the [advanced filters](/nodes/data/cloud-data/query-records#advanced-filters). This means that you can connect it directly to a query records if you set it in **Javascript** filter mode and provide the following filter code.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/library/prefabs/filters/filters-qr-props-1.png)

</div>

```javascript
where(Inputs.Filter)
```

The value on the <span class="ndl-data">Filters</span> output is a Javascript object with an [advanced filters](/nodes/data/cloud-data/query-records#advanced-filters) matching the expected input on the query records.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background xl">

![](/library/prefabs/filters/filters-filter-output.png)

</div>

When the filter has change a signal will be sent on the <span class="ndl-signal">Filter Changed</span> output. This is useful for triggering a fetch on the datasource you are using. In this example above it's connected to the <span class="ndl-signal">Do</span>
input of the query records node.

## Filter Controls

Now, to replace the default filters you need to edit the `Filters` property (of the `Filters` prefab component, phew lot of filters here...) or connect to the input if you want to dynamically create your filters.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/library/prefabs/filters/filters-props-1.png)

</div>


The format for the property is an array where each entry in the array maps to a certain type of filter control. Common for all controls is that they need the following properties:

```javascript
[
    {
        Name:"xyz", // This is a unique identifier of the filter control
        Type:"Range", // The type of filter control, see types below
        // ... control sepecific properties
    }
]
```

Lets dive into different types of filter controls.

### Slider

The **Slider** filter control can be used to create a filter for a **Number** property.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/library/prefabs/filters/filters-slider-1.png)

</div>

To add a **Slider** to the filter controls use this entry format in the filters array:

```javascript
[
    {
        Name:"MinLevel", // A unique name for this filter control
        Type:"Slider", // The slider type
        Label:"Level", // A label for the slider
        Max:5, // Max value
        Min:0, // Min Value
        Step:1, // The size in value for one "step" of the slider
        Property:"Level", // This is the property of the class in query records that you want the filter to apply to
        
        // The test property is the test that will be added to the filters output, this can be any of
        // lessThan, lessThanOrEqualTo, greaterThan or greaterThanOrEqualTo
        Test:"greaterThanOrEqualTo"
    }
]
```

### Range

A **Range** filter control is similar to a slider except it has a start and end interval.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/library/prefabs/filters/filters-range-1.png)

</div>

To add a **Range** control to the filter controls use this entry format in the filters array:

```javascript
[
    {
        Name:"MinMaxLevel", // A unique name for this filter control
        Type:"Slider", // The slider type
        Label:"Level", // A label for the slider
        Max:5, // Max value
        Min:0, // Min Value
        Step:1, // The size in value for one "step" of the slider
        Property:"Level", // This is the property of the records in query records that you want the filter to apply to
    }
]
```

### Checkbox

The **Checkbox** control can be used to turn a filter test on and off. If the checkbox is checked the specific condition will be added to the filter, if not it will be removed.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/library/prefabs/filters/filters-checkbox-1.png)

</div>

To add a **Checkbox** control to the filter controls use this entry format in the filters array:

```javascript
[
    {
        Name:"Remote", // A unique name for this filter control
        Type:"Checkbox", // Type for the checkbox
        Label:"Only remote workers", // A label shown above the control
        Text:"Remote", // This is the text to the right of the checkbox
        Property:"Remote", // The property of the records in the query records where the condition should be applied
        Test:{equalTo:true} // The condition test, choose any from the advanced query section in query records
    }
]
```

### Multi Choice

This control will allow you to filter on a string property of your record by giving a set of options to choose from.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/library/prefabs/filters/filters-multi-choice-1.png)

</div>

To add a **Multi Choice** control to the filter controls use this entry format in the filters array:

```javascript
[
    {
        Name:"NameChoice", // A unique name for this filter control
        Type:"Multi Choice", // The type for the multi choice
        Label:"Show only names", // A label shown above the control
        Labels:['Bart','Lisa','Marge','Homer','Maggie'], // The labels for the options (whats shown in the UI)
        Options:['bart','lisa','marge','homer','maggie'], // The values that are used for the filter condition, this should match your db
        Property:"Name", // The property of the records in the query records where the condition should be applied
    }
]
```

### Single Choice

The **Single Choice** filter control allows you to provide a number of different choices where the user can only pick one and for each choice there is a corresponding **Test** that will be added to the filter if that choice is checked.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/library/prefabs/filters/filters-single-choice-1.png)

</div>

To add a **Single Choice** control to the filter controls use this entry format in the filters array:

```javascript
[
    {
        Name:"SexSingleChoice", // A unique name for this filter control
        Type:"Single Choice", // The type for the single choice 
        Label:"Pick one", // A label shown above the filter control

        Labels:["Any","Female","Male"], // Labels for the different options
        Options:["any","female","male"], // The values for the different options, this relates to the tests below

        // This is the conditions that are added to the filter corresponding to the particular choice
        // if the option is not listed below no condition will be added
        Tests:{
            "male":{Name:{containedIn:["Homer","Bart"]}},
            "female":{Name:{containedIn:["Lisa","Marge","Maggie"]}}
        }
    },
]
```

### Date Filter

With the **Date Filter** control you can add a date input to your filter controls and the resulting filter can include a condition based on the selected date.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/library/prefabs/filters/filters-date-filter-1.png)

</div>

To add a **Date Filter** control to the filter controls use this entry format in the filters array:

```javascript
[
    {
        Name:"MaxDate", // A unique name for this filter control
        Type:"Date Filter", // The date filter type
        Label:"Hired before", // A label shown above the date filter control
        Property:"HireDate", // The property of the records in the query records where the condition should be applied
        Test:"lessThan", // The test that makes up the condition for the filter
    }
] 
```

### Text Search

The **Text Search** filter control create a text input where the user can put a search string. It will create a condition on a given property, that should be a string, that will filter on records containing the text.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/library/prefabs/filters/filters-text-search-1.png)

</div>

To add a **Text Search** control to the filter controls use this entry format in the filters array:

```javascript
[
    {
        Name:"NameSearch", // A unique name for this filter control
        Type:"Text Search", // The text search type
        Label:"Filter names", // A label shown above the filter contorl
        Property:"Name" // The name of the property on the record that should be searched in
    }
]
```

## Filter Values

Sometimes you only need the filter values, this is available on the <span class="ndl-data">Filter Values</span> it is a regular javascript object with the values as properties with the names corresponding to the **Name** property in the filter controls. When the filter values changes a signal will be emitted on the <span class="ndl-signal">Filter Values Changed</span> output.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background xl">

![](/library/prefabs/filters/filters-filter-values.png)

</div>

This is also useful if you want to provide presents for your filters. You can provide them via the <span class="ndl-data">Filter Values</span> input on the `Filters` prefab component using the same format as the output.

## Reset

By setting a property in the **Filter Values** object to `null` the corresponding filter controll will be reset to default and the condition will be removed from the **Filter** output. If you want to reset all filter controls you can send a signal to the input <span class="ndl-signal">Reset</span> on the `Filters` prefab.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background xl">
