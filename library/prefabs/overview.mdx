# Prefabs

Prefabs allow you to clone a pre-built component and use it in your project. The component can be used as is, or tweaked to your needs by opening it up and modifying its internal building blocks.

Learn how to import a prefabs to your project [here](/docs/guides/user-interfaces/modules).
