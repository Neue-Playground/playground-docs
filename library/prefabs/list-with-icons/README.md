# List With Icons

This is a very simple list component that you can use as starting point for building your own custom lists.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background l">

![](/library/prefabs/list-with-icons/list-with-icons.png)

</div>

## Basic usage

You specify the items of the list by editing the **Items** array in the **List With Icons** component. Below is the default value.

```javascript
[
    {
        // Icons are references to material icons, 
        // see https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Icons
        Icon:"account_circle",
        Label:"List Item 1"
    },
    {
        Icon:"account_circle",
        Label:"List Item 2"
    },
    {
        Icon:"account_circle",
        Label:"List Item 3"
    }   
]
```

- **Icon** This is an icon identifier, you can find a list of all supported icons [here](https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Icons).
- **Label** The label that should be shown for the list item.

## Item Clicked

The list has an output signal called **Item Clicked** when an item is clicked, and the output **Item Id** will contain the id of the object corresponding to that item.

<div className="ndl-image-with-background xl">

![](/library/prefabs/list-with-icons/list-with-icons-1.png)

</div>

The function node in the above example contains the following code:

```javascript
const clickedListItem = Noodl.Objects[Inputs.ItemId]

console.log("This item was clicked: " + clickedListItem.Label)
```

## Customizing

Like most UI Components in the library this is a great staring point for building your own lists. The best way is to look at the **Item** sub component of the **List With Icons** component. Here you can see how the **Label** and **Icon** are connected from the **Repeater Object**. 

<div className="ndl-image-with-background xl">

![](/library/prefabs/list-with-icons/list-with-icons-2.png)

</div>

It's a starting point to build your own custom list items.
