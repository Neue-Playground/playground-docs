# Getting Started

This section contains the Javascript API reference documentation, samples and guides on how to extend Noodl with core nodes. Most Javascript is used in your project as part of nodes, most notably the [Function](/nodes/javascript/function) and [Script](/nodes/javascript/script) nodes. You can learn more about how to use Javascript in your Noodl projects in the [Client side business logic with Javascript guide](/docs/guides/business-logic/client-side-biz-logic-js), or when writing Javascript in cloud functions [Javascript In Cloud Functions](/docs/guides/cloud-logic/javascript).

This section is devided into the following sub sections:

* **References** Here you will find the API reference documentation.
* **Samples** Here you will find small useful samples of how you can use the Javascript API.
* **Extending** Here you will find documentation on how to write your own Noodl modules and create your own core Noodl nodes.
